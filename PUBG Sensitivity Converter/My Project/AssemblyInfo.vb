<Assembly: AssemblyDescription("This program was made by a 20 year old student from Belgium. I made this program to automate the conversion of CSGO to PUBG sensitivity. There is an online conversion tool, but it takes a while to open up the config file and copy+paste the values into it since PUBG made their config file so messy. Credits to 'True Gent' for providing the formulas.")>
